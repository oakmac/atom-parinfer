# Parinfer Lib [![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/shaunlebron/parinfer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shaunlebron/parinfer)

This is the canonical implementation of [Parinfer]'s core transformation
functions. Though it is written in JavaScript, it is ported and synchronized to
other languages to reach most major text editors.

- [Parinfer Code Documentation][code.md] - Read for deep knowledge on inner workings.

## A stable core for editor plugins

The behavior and implementation of the Parinfer library is stable and
canonicalized.  To allow different editors to use it, we have ported the
implementation to the languages required by the plugin
APIs of most major text editors.  All language ports pass the same
comprehensive test suite to help ensure consistent behavior.

## Installation

```
npm install parinfer
```

or download `parinfer.js` from [latest release] and include directly in html:

[latest release]:https://github.com/shaunlebron/parinfer/releases/latest

```html
<script src="parinfer.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Parinfer consists of a couple pure functions of your text, returning new text with
corrected parens or indentation.

```js
// 'parinfer' is a global object if not used as Node module.
var parinfer = require('parinfer');

// Run Indent Mode on the given text:
var result = parinfer.indentMode("(def foo [a b");
console.log(result.text);
// prints:
// (def foo [a b])

// Run Paren Mode on the given text:
var result = parinfer.parenMode("(def foo\n[a b\nc])");
console.log(result.text);
// prints:
// (def foo
//  [a b
//   c])
```

## Integrating with an Editor or REPL

_See [integrating.md]_

## API

##### `indentMode(text[, options])`
##### `parenMode(text[, options])`

Runs
[Indent Mode](http://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/#indent-mode)
or
[Paren Mode](http://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/#paren-mode)
on the given text.

Arguments:

- `text` is the full text input.
- `options` is an object with the following properties:
  - `cursorLine` - zero-based line number of the cursor
  - `cursorX` - zero-based x-position of the cursor
  - `cursorDx` - (Paren Mode only) indicates the amount the cursor moved horizontally if something was inserted or deleted in order to help preserve relative indentation of child expressions ([see docs][cursorDx]).
  - `partialResult` - return partially processed text/cursor if an error occurs (defaults to false)

<!-- file links need to be full path to make them work for the NPM readme -->
[cursorDx]:https://github.com/shaunlebron/parinfer/blob/master/lib/doc/code.md#preserving-relative-indentation-while-typing

Returns an object with the following properties:

- `success` is a boolean indicating if the input was properly formatted enough to create a valid result
- `text` is the full text output (if `success` is false, returns original text unless `partialResult` is enabled)
- `cursorX`/`cursorLine` is the new position of the cursor (since parinfer may shift it around)
- `error` is an object populated if `success` is false:
  - `name` is the name of the error, which will be any of the following:
    - `"quote-danger"`
    - `"eol-backslash"`
    - `"unclosed-quote"`
    - `"unclosed-paren"`
    - `"unmatched-close-paren"`
    - `"unhandled"`
  - `message` is a message describing the error
  - `lineNo` is a zero-based line number where the error occurred
  - `x` is a zero-based column where the error occurred
  - `extra` has lineNo and x of open-paren for `unmatched-close-paren`
- `tabStops` is an array of objects representing [Tab stops], which is
  populated in Indent Mode if a cursor position is supplied. We identify tab
  stops at relevant open-parens, and supply the following extra information so
  you may compute extra tab stops for one-space or two-space indentation
  conventions based on the type of open-paren.
  - `x` is a zero-based x-position of the tab stop
  - `lineNo` is a zero-based line number of the open-paren responsible for the tab stop
  - `ch` is the character of the open-paren responsible for the tab stop (e.g. `(`,`[`,`{`)
